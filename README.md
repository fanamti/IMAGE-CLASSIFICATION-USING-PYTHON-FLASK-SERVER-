# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-PYTHON-FLASK-SERVER-
Image classification is the processing of computer vision but curved by a machine. The 
machine is programmed to act like a human being. The Data is used to program the 
machine. In this study, data was retrieved from Fatkun Google Chrome. Built a model and 
training that model using python, the OpenCV library, numpy for data cleaning, matplotlib, 
seaboard for data visualization and sklearn for model creation. I will do the cleaning data 
and the training model to help the machine understand how to act when in each situation of 
our project and after that Build a flask server on python flask sever to allow once Iâ€™ve 
uploaded an image into my dataset. A classification on the study of face and two-eye 
recognition Har cascade libraries will be done. 
 The result will be displayed on the terminal local server integrated with the database. 
Enthusiastic about deep learning (computer vision) and machine learning this project is a 
combination of my own knowledge on using opencv for classification of an image using the 
data, cleaning data, and training data and python flask server side with flask module to run 
server after writing all the function. The result is that when I upload an image to my python 
flask server , the program will be able to show who the person is and the probability of that 
to other personality in the dataset I have .
